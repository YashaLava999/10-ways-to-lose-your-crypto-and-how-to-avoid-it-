Test operation over a secure HTTPS connection
You need to pay attention to whether the site works through the secure “https” protocol. In other words, does the site have an SSL certificate?

In this abbreviation, the letter "s" stands for "secured". With https, data between the site and your computer is encrypted during transmission. This means they are more difficult for fraudsters to intercept. In addition, pay attention to the images of the “lock” in the address bar to see if there is one.

If there is no lock, this is not a safe site, close it.

To work over a secure connection, install a browser extension that runs https wherever possible. For example, HTTPS Everywhere from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

Other ways to verify site authenticity:

whether the site is included in blacklists. For example, here: VirusTotal, MX Toolbox, Sitechecker. These services use several antivirus programs at once. To check, enter the URL of the site you are checking into the search bar on the service website, press Enter and the service will instantly return results.

Overall, Malwarebytes has an industry-average detection rate of around 95%, which is pretty good. The Threat Scan is a good option for users who want to quickly check their files for malware, and I found it easy to select whether to scan a single folder or my entire disk with the Custom Scan option.
